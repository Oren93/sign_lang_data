# Icelandic Sign Language Data Collection Project

**This project aims to build a user friendly platform for sign language data collection.**

_Funded by the Icelandic innovation fund (Rannís) and is built in collaboration with the communication center._

We first focus on the Icelandic deaf community, but we aim to bring it to other countries, regions and languages later on.

## Weekly Meeting Notes

### 27/5/2024

We met with representatives of the communication center, and a deaf programmer, Árni, who will likely join us for two months. We discussed the best approaches to collect data, one way is the platform we are building, another way, which they take charge with, is to collect existing data from many different sources, including children interactive books, news with sign caption, and other sources traced back to 1996.

We then discussed possible features we would like to have on our website:

**Backend**

- **User authenthication** - sign up, log in, profile settings.
- **Design a correctly structured database:**
  - **Users table** - Login info, hashed password, Email...
  - **Profiles** - Age, language, region, deaf or not, and other factors that may influence the language.
  - **Glosses** - List of glosses (words/patterns) that we would like to record, ideally ordered by popularity.
  - **Recordings** - Metadata about the recorded videos.
  - **Badges** - Gamified experience, to encourage users to contribute.
- **Vocabulary** - Build a dictionary of possible glosses, prioritize by popularity.
- **Video Storing** - Explore the best approach for storing the videos.

**Frontend**

- **UI whit good UX:**
  - **Instant recording** - Hassle free, minimal clicks to start recording, countdown after press strart.
  - **Preview** - Possibility to play the recorded video before submitting.
  - **Smooth transition** - Allow instantly to move to the next gloss after submitting.

Lastly we came up with a very short to do list for the coming week

**To Do**

- Prioritize feature
- Start coding the most important features.
